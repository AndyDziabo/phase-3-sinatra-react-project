<h1>Fantasy Football App</h1>

Our Fantasy Football Website lets users create a group of teams to go head to head vs the people they invite to their group. It will let users favorite players that they would like to get drafted into their team and our draft simulation will draft a team based on the players they favorited. Once the user has their team drafted they will get the ability to start and bench players.
